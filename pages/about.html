<h1 class="text-center fw-bold my-0">About Me</h1>
<p>
    I am an often times bitter, resentful, impatient and a hundred times frustrated web developer who hardly has any work experience, not only in web development but also in general,
    who <s>wasted</s> spent 2 or 3 years of his life learning application development because somebody somewhere promised him that that was the career of the future
    and hopefully I could not be a bum anymore. Regrettably, during my time in the first developer job I had there was a ton of miscomunication that led to me being put in an ultimatum prior to getting sacked,
    and during that time I also got burgled out of two whole monthly wages (at the time) in property. Now at 30-something and still living with my family,
    I've gotten fed up with throwing out résumés and having everyone tell me that I'm not a good candidate or that they found someone better,
    and with my family telling me that I eat too much and I have to go on a diet "for everyone's sake", I have now decided that this nerdy geeky failure lifestyle has gone for long enough
    and I'm not gonna get a job as a developer anytime soon because everyone expects me to be an expert in 250 million trillion quadrillion technologies.
    I don't care that everyone keeps telling me that I "have to" get a top tier job because of my skills and my level of English, they clearly haven't been out there throwing out résumés and getting rejected a hundred times, both in English and in their native language.
</p>
<p>
    So I did what any other rational human being would do and I decided to temporarily give up on my dreams of being a developer and now I'm gonna look for a regular day job at a car wash or a convenience store or similar,
    like everybody else has had to do once in their life.
</p>
<p>
    Except for rich kids - those people are horribly adjusted to reality. Just like me! Except I don't have rich parents so in my case it's unsustainable and I decided that it's time to stop this.
