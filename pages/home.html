    <h3 class="fs-italic text-right">What even is a broke?</h3>
    <h4 class="fs-italic text-center">Can you into broke?</h4>
    <p class="text-center">All these questions have answers. Sit back and read!</p>
    <p class="text-center">All of the following methods can be tried individually or combined!</p>
    <h5><u>Method #1: Spend Years on a Career that Won't Get You a Stable Job</u></h5>
    <p>
        It's always boring to go for the safe options. You could study logistics, law, engineering, architecture, but those are hard and boring. And we don't like hard and boring! We like friendly and fun and quirky, and most importantly, prestigious-sounding! That way, it sounds like we're <s>wasting</s> spending our time on something grandious and productive!
        So our best bets are along the lines of: musical composition, any art career whatsoever, animation, audio and/or video editing, and of course, programming. Sure, everyone says that programming is the future, but can a programmer fix a broken pipeline, pave the streets, or sell you a cold refreshing soda at 2 am? I don't think so. They also say that music is the universal language, but can a musician mediate between nations for world peace, or clean up the streets or even just patch up a punctured tube in your bike? I sure as hell don't think so.</p>
    <p>
        This is one of the most typical methods to go broke. Get up on your saddle of self-importance and waste your life telling yourself you're doing something useful for society and for yourself!

    </p>
    <h5><u>Method #2: Learn to Make Computer Music</u></h5>
    <p>
        There are very few less rewarding endeavours as this. <b>BONUS POINTS IF YOU DECIDE TO MAKE CHIPTUNE!</b> Every musician forum you go there's bound to be some stuck-up douchebag who thinks they're superior to every other mortal on this earth
        because they can fit a hundred arpeggios in a very obscure sound chip on an obscure rusting circuit board enclosed in battered 30 or 40 year-old plastic (especially in the <a href="https://forums.famitracker.org" target="_blank"><s>FamiTracker forums.</s></a> (Whoops! They went out of business! Try the <a href="https://battleofthebits.org" target="_blank">Battle of the Bits Liceum</a> instead. ðŸ˜Š)).
    </p>
    <p>
        Hell, you don't even have to aim for chiptune for that, just get into tracker music in general! <a href="https://modarchive.org" target="_blank">ModArchive</a> is full of pompous people that will not enjoy a song unless it's "innovative". Forget expressing yourself, what matters is that you can show off how technically advanced you are
        to other people who are just as lost and purposeless as you are!
    </p>

    </p>
    <h5><u>Method #3: Get into Crypto</u></h5>
    <p>
        Of course everyone says that you should get a job to earn a living. Pffft! What those losers don't know is that you can simply get yourself a crazy expensive graphics card and mine crypto currencies until the world ends! You too can get rich by doing nothing at the cost of our environmental safety!
    </p>
    <p>
        Crypto offers many advantages: you can speculate to buy cheap and sell expensive, or to buy expensive and sell depressingly cheap - that's an instant method to go broke if there is one! But do you want to know an even quicker way? <b>NFTs!</b> NFTs are cool PNGs that you can make on MSPaint and sell for hundreds of millions of dollars to the next big idiot that wants to get rich quick.
    </p>
    <p>
        Which takes us to the next subject: kleptocracy! You can easily <b>scam</b> people who haven't had enough exposure to the internet or scam emails and other such tactics to take money away from innocent and unsuspecting people. How do you do that? Ask for payments via Bitcoin! Once again crypto saves the day!

    <h5><u>Method #4: Play Lots of Videogames</u></h5>
    <p>
        Very few saddles of self-importance are as pompous and pointless as being the best at some videogame, whether is it a mainstream videogame or a very niche thing that nobody's ever heard of.
        Plus with videogames you get to temporarily forget about the grim reality of your fucked up room with food leftovers in every corner and grimy kitchen appliances, you just turn off the lights and sink in the virtual reality of your videogame. Who cares if it's the 8th month or the 10th year you're living off of mom's pensions, what matters is to rescue the world from Ultimecia compressing time!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can get into pointless fights with people online about whether the original or remastered version of some game is better, you can also go and hunt feminists to argue about gratuitous boob physics and other such displays, and of course, every videogame has tons upon tons of Rule34 art so there's yet <i>another</i> time waster which is also great fun!
    </p>
    <p>
        Get this: you can also react to situations and statements with HILARIOUS QUOTES from videogames!:

        <li>I used to be a programmer like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee.</li>
        <li>Get over here!</li>
        <li>You Failed!</li>
        <li>YOU DIED</li>
        <li>Nice of the princess to invite us over for a picnic, gay Luigi?</li>
    </ul>
